Take off!
6pm, Bonjela complexion
Taking off
Stress at four is forbid
Silence 6pm
Bonjela completion
To servant
To servant to stress
Take it off
Too stressed
To Simon, to chef
Ersatz! Ersatz!
Invest, toupee!
Enter, tidying, tied in!
Echoed eyeballs
By skips
Take off
Grating three-fold
In a furrow
Lack of paper
Take off
You never told me, Simon
About the forty carat scum
At Newquay train station
Take off at weekends!
Digest, ingest
Taking, success
Source, to chef
Digress, ingest
Take off
In success, respect
Digress, before
Eon, take off
Stop, take off
