It's a curse
Well thy forsooth
Who is that interesting hack over there?
By Gad, verily
Cracked curse
Disliked... disliked
Burdened
It's a curse
And am not unguilty of using it

"You, your tone is...
You tone of everybody"

Trying to bolt out of
Trying to get over
Operation mind fuck

"I do not like your tone
It has ephemeral whinging aspects"

It's a curse
It's a curse
I am not unguilty of using it

Waiting for you to f...
Trying to get out of
Tryna get out of
Waiting
They are waiting, bitterly, for you to fall over
It's a curse

Down their long egg breath
Cheap shaving lotion days
Their sandwiches stashed under their side seats
Their froglike chins ready to burst
I tell you, it's a curse, it's a burden, it's a curse
Trying to get over bargain vampires
In shops
I tell you it's a curse

"You, your tone is...
You, your tone is..."
Trying to get out of
It's a curse
Shafted over
It's a curse
It's a burden
That's a burden
Operation Mind-Fuck

Look back bores
It's a curse
Bach and Wagner
All you really need is a good Schwartz
It's a curse
Balti and Vimto and Spangles
Were always crap
Regardless of the look back bores

It's a curse
It's a curse
It's a curse
Shafted over
Shafted over
Shafted over
It's a curse
Shafted over
Trying to bolt out of
Waiting for you
It's a curse
I tell ya, it's a curse
