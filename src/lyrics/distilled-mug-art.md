Oh two
Dot three, oh

(The god)
The god is going down now (Is going down)
Red cup growing on desk (Red cup)
Burnt on digital
Slow
More widening

Oh two
Point nineteen

Whilst the engineers
Trying to pick up bits
Left and top of screen

Two point one one

Whilst they are amusing themselves
Trying to make politicians or actors look funny or better
According to their present or ingrained past beliefs

Two point, oh six

Good idea for war history programme
Torn off bits of pictures of barbed wire

One point four nine
One point four nine eight

Distilled mug art
Digital distilled altered art
Distilled cut off screen
Digital'd by mugs

One point, oh seven three
Distilling mugs
Alter top of heads
And make them nasty-like

One point, oh five

Put in a paper or CD cover
Oh oh, point five eight
And give the folks mumps to order with their apple shape

Oh oh
Six eight
Distilled to order
Faces distilled to order
Digital mug art
