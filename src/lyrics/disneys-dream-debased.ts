export const disneysDream = `The day the dream went right back to base
There was blood on the ground
Blood on the sand
Blood all around
Tracks of the ride of the bright murder hawk
The day the dream debased and went home
And the people did mill to those adrenaline rails
And everything stopped

The nurses climbed up
Our face paled
And there was no doubt at all
No two ways about it
Was the day Disney's dream debased

Saw a mouse, who flapped at my wife
And she told him what
And she told him what had gone down
Who then did not know the extent of the show
The people had (died/gave?) in the mouth of their ride

Disney

And Dopey and Mickey, Brer and Pluto
Secretly prayed
And there was no doubt at all
No two ways about it
Was the day Disney's dream debased

Disney

Dark glasses on Western Union
Man the gates
The dream, an innocent meets her fate
Far away from Appalachia and the city hate
The day
The day
The day

When there was no doubt at all
No maybe about it
It was the day the dream debased

Disney

I remembered it from
The back of my mind
The tune that I wrote
In fallen dreams
Anthem to
Creator of all that had stopped

So there was no doubt at all
No two ways about it
It was the day the dream debased`;
