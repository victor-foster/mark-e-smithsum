export const imTotallyWired = `I'm totally wired.
Can't you see?
I'm totally wired.

Can't you see?
My butterfly stomach
Growls growls
I drank a jar of coffee
Then I took some of these

And now I'm totally wired.

Life leaves you surprised.
Slaps you in the eyes
And I was a communist
A rich man would bail me.
The opposite applies.
The morning light
Another fresh fight
Another row
Right right right right

And I'm totally wired.

You don't have to be weird to be wired
You don't have to be an American to be strange
You don't have to be strange to be strange
You don't have to be weird to be weird.

I'm totally wired.

My heart and I agree.

I'm always worried.`;
