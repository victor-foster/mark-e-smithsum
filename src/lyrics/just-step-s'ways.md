When what used to excite you does not
Like you've used up all your allowance of experiences
Head filled with a mass of too-well-known people
([This is an important aspect of Big Priest.
His hypnotic induction process.
His] commercial last chance)
Just step sideways from this world today
Just step sideways round this place today
Just step sideways round this world today
Just step outside this grubby place today
Don't ever hit that vulgar cave
The joker says: 'Go the opposite way'
Just step outside this futurist world today
Just step right round this... today
The Eastern Bloc rocks to Elton John.
So just step sideways from this place today
To be a celebrity you've gotta eat the past, nowadays
But who wants to be in a Hovis advert, anyway?
Just step right round this futurist world today
Just step outside this grubby place today
Just skip out miss the ice flicks of Bacardi
Just step outside this future world today
Don't let it beat ya
Don't let it whip ya
Jump on the back of nicotine
Hit those lung wurm back rays
Just step outside this future world today
Today X6
.World today
Just step sideways from this place today
Jump on the back of nicotine
Just step outside this future world today
Today X 4
