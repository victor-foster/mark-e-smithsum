export const rudeAllTheTime = `Cool as a breeze she blows
Autumn she reaps and summer she sows
But she's rude all the time
Rude all the time

Where did you get your looks?
Did you get them from a book?
You look like you just don't care
[I really like your hair] (2)

Cool as a breeze she blows
Autumn she reaps and summer she sows
She's rude all the time

Where did you get your looks
Did you grab them while mugging a cook?
You look as if you don't care
What about your new head of hair?

You had to be, 1-2-3-4!

Cool as a breeze she blows
Autumn she reaps and summer she sows
Rude all the time
Rude all the time

You're a degenerated half-wit
And you live on a drop of milk from a thimble

[I wanna take you home
I wanna be with you
I wanna take you home
I wanna sleep with you

Cool as a breeze she blows
Autumn she reaps and summer she sows
She's rude all the time
Rude all the time

It's like when you're in love
The choice is hard and rough
Suppose I've got it wrong
A little something to end this song`;
